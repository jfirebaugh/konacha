Konacha ([koh-NAH-cha], a type of green tea) is a Rails engine that allows you to test your JavaScript with the
[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework and [chai](http://chaijs.com/)
assertion library.

It is similar to [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem) and
[Evergreen](https://github.com/jnicklas/evergreen), but does not attempt to be framework
agnostic. By sticking with Rails, Konacha can take full advantage of features such as
the asset pipeline and engines.

## Installation

Add konacha to the `:test` and `:development` groups in the Gemfile and `bundle install`:

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'konacha'
end
```

## Usage

Create a `spec/javascripts` directory and name the files in it with a `_spec`
(or `_test`) suffix. You can write the specs in either JavaScript or
CoffeeScript, using a `.js` or `.js.coffee` extension respectively, like you
would any other script asset.

Require the assets under test and any other dependencies using Sprockets directives.
For example, suppose you wanted to test your cool JavaScript `Array#sum` method, which
you placed in `app/assets/javascripts/array_sum.js`. Write the specs in JavaScript in
the file `spec/javascripts/array_sum_spec.js`:

```javascript
//= require array_sum

describe("Array#sum", function() {
  it("returns 0 when the Array is empty", function() {
    [].sum().should.equal(0);
  });

  it("returns the sum of numeric elements", function() {
    [1,2,3].sum().should.equal(6);
  });
});
```

Or, if you prefer CoffeeScript, in `spec/javascripts/array_sum_spec.js.coffee`:

```coffeescript
#= require array_sum

describe "Array#sum", ->
  it "returns 0 when the Array is empty", ->
    [].sum().should.equal(0)

  it "returns the sum of numeric elements", ->
    [1,2,3].sum().should.equal(6)
```

Your tests are run inside an iframe. You have the entire `<body>` element to
yourself, and it is automatically reset between tests.

## Running (Rake Tasks)

### In the Browser

To start a server for your tests, type:

```
$ bundle exec rake konacha:serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500) in your browser, and
you will see all your tests running. You can also go to a sub-page to run an
individual spec file (e.g. `http://localhost:3500/array_sum_spec`), or a path
to a subdirectory to run a subset of specs (e.g.
`http://localhost:3500/models`).

This is the recommended mode for development, since you can simply hit refresh
to reload all your test and asset files. To debug tests, use the `debugger`
statement anywhere in a test to halt execution.

To run code in the JavaScript console, be sure to select the desired iframe
first, so your code runs in the correct context.

### Command-Line Runner

To run your tests from the command line, type:

```
$ bundle exec rake konacha:run
```

To run individual specs, pass a comma separated list of spec file names via
the `SPEC` environment variable.

```
$ bundle exec rake konacha:run SPEC=foo_spec
$ bundle exec rake konacha:run SPEC=foo_spec,bar_spec,etc_spec
```

Konacha includes a default formatter modeled upon RSpec's ProgressFormatter.
Additionally, Konacha's runner implements the same protocol as RSpec, so many
RSpec formatters also work with Konacha.

To specify one or more formatters, provide a comma separated list of class names
in the `FORMAT` environment variable. For example, you can run both Ruby and JavaScript
specs with CI integration using [ci_reporter](https://github.com/nicksieger/ci_reporter):

```
$ bundle exec rake ci:setup:rspec spec konacha:run FORMAT=CI::Reporter::RSpec
```

You will need to `require` any formatters you use. It's a good idea to do this
within a `defined?` check in your [Konacha initializer](#configuration).

To automatically trigger reruns when files change, try [guard-konacha](https://github.com/alexgb/guard-konacha).

## Spec Helper

Since Konacha integrates with the asset pipeline, using setup helpers in your specs is
easy. Just create a `spec_helper.js` or `spec_helper.js.coffee` file in `spec/javascripts`
and require it in your tests:

```javascript
//= require spec_helper
//= require array_sum

describe("Array#sum", function() {
  ...
});
```

The `spec_helper` is a good place to set Mocha and Chai options as well, for instance:

```javascript
// set the Mocha test interface
// see http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/#interfaces
mocha.ui('bdd');

// ignore the following globals during leak detection
mocha.globals(['YUI']);

// or, ignore all leaks
mocha.ignoreLeaks();

// set slow test timeout in ms
mocha.timeout(5);

// Show stack trace on failing assertion.
chai.Assertion.includeStack = true;
```

## Directives and Asset Bundling

We suggest that you explicitly require just the assets necessary for each spec.
Konacha runs each spec file in isolation, and requiring things explicitly will help
ensure your scripts don't accumulate hidden dependencies and tight coupling.

However, you are free to ignore this advice and require the entire application.js asset
bundle in your specs or spec helper, or a bundled subset of assets. Requiring bundled
assets works like it does in Rails development mode -- Konacha will detect the complete
set of dependencies and generate a separate script tag for each one. You won't have to
search through a many thousand line application.js bundle to debug a spec failure.

## Configuration

Konacha can be configured in an initializer, e.g. `config/initializers/konacha.rb`:

```ruby
Konacha.configure do |config|
  config.spec_dir     = "spec/javascripts"
  config.spec_matcher = /_spec\.|_test\./
  config.driver       = :selenium
  config.stylesheets  = %w(application)
end if defined?(Konacha)
```

The `defined?` check is necessary to avoid a dependency on Konacha in the production
environment.

The `spec_dir` option tells Konacha where to find JavaScript specs.  `spec_matcher`
is an object responding to `===` (most likely a `Regexp`); it receives a filename
and should return true if the file is a spec. `driver` names a Capybara driver used
for the `run` task (try `:poltergeist`, after installing
[PhantomJS](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs)).
The `stylesheets` option sets the stylesheets to be linked from the `<head>`
of the test runner iframe.

The values above are the defaults.

## Test Interface and Assertions

Konacha includes a vendored copy of mocha.js and the [chai](http://chaijs.com/)
assertion libraries. By default, it configures Mocha to use the "BDD" test
interface, which provides `describe()`, `it()`, `before()`, `after()`,
`beforeEach()`, and `afterEach()`.

Konacha will make all three of chai's assertion styles available to you: `expect`,
`should`, and `assert`. See the chai documentation for the details.

If you use jQuery, you may want to check out [chai-jquery](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/chai-jquery)
for some jQuery-specific assertions. There are a lot of interesting chai
matchers out there, see [the chai plugins page](http://chaijs.com/plugins)

To make all these available for your konacha environment, see the
[Konacha-chai-matchers gem](https://github.com/matthijsgroen/konacha-chai-matchers)

## Templates / Fixtures

Konacha has no template (a.k.a. HTML fixture) support of its own. Instead, we suggest you use
Sprocket's built in support for JavaScript template (`.jst`) files. Add a `spec/javascripts/templates`
directory, place template files there (using any JS template language supported by Sprockets),
require them in your spec or spec_helper, and render them into the `<body>`.

Note that if you want to use EJS as in the following example, you need to add that gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "ejs"
```

For example, in `spec/javascripts/templates/hello.jst.ejs`:

```html
<h1>Hello Konacha!</h1>
```

In `spec_helper.js`:

```javascript
//= require_tree ./templates
```

And your spec:

```javascript
//= require spec_helper

describe("templating", function() {
  it("is built in to Sprockets", function() {
    $('body').html(JST['templates/hello']());
    $('body h1').text().should.equal('Hello Konacha!');
  });
});
```

## Upgrading from Konacha 1.x

### Iframe

As of Konacha 2.0, each test file is run inside an isolated iframe. For
compatibility with Konacha 1.x, the iframe's `<body>` element will have
`id="konacha"` set on it.

Previously, all test files would run in the same environment. Thus, if only
one test file pulled in an external library, all tests would be able to use
it. Now test files are run in isolation. If you encounter an undefined
JavaScript module in your test, you may be missing an explicit `//= require`
call somewhere.

### Options

In Konacha 1.x you would set `Konacha.mochaOptions` in `konacha_config.js`:

```javascript
// Old syntax
Konacha.mochaOptions.ignoreLeaks = true;
```

The `konacha_config.js` file is no longer used by Konacha 2.0. Instead, call
Mocha's own methods in [`spec_helper.js`](#spec-helper):

```javascript
// New syntax
mocha.ignoreLeaks();
```

### Global `mocha`

Konacha 2.0 ships with an upgraded Mocha. Some objects that were previously
available on the global `mocha` object might now be located on `Mocha`. If you
get an error message to this effect, adjust your code accordingly.

## Contributing

```bash
git clone git://github.com/jfirebaugh/konacha.git
```

Run `bundle exec rake` to run the test suite.

### Contributing to Mocha and Chai

The Konacha repository includes the
[Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) and
[Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) repositories as submodules, so
you can hack on them directly:

```bash
cd mocha # or: cd chai
git checkout master
... hack-hack-hack ...
bundle exec rake assets # make and cp assets based on your changes
```

Assuming your app's Gemfile points at your Konacha checkout (`gem 'konacha',
:path => '~/path/to/konacha'`), your changes to Mocha and Chai are live in
localhost:3500 when you refresh your browser.

You can send pull requests to Mocha and Chai straight out of your submodules.
